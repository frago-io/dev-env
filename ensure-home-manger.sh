What do you plan to do?

    1. We install Nix for you and yourself only (single-user mode)

    2. Install it yourself in multi-user mode

    3. We forget about you, you forget about us, life goes on 

NOTE: If you choose single-user mode, no other users can use/install 
      Nix in your system until a multi-user switch is made
